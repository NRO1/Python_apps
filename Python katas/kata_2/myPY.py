    This function gets a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']',
    and determines if the input string is valid.
    An input string is valid if:
        Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
        Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
    e.g.
    s = '[[{()}](){}]'  -> True
    s = '[{]}'          -> False
